# ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ Microservices Architecture

## Description
The **Library Management System** is a modern, distributed application for managing books, users, borrowing operations, and notifications.  
Built with a **Spring Boot microservices architecture**, it integrates service discovery, API gateway routing, event-driven communication with **Kafka**, and a relational database with **PostgreSQL**.  
The project is containerized with **Docker Compose** for easy deployment.

---

## Key Features
- **User Management**:
  - User registration, authentication, and role-based access control.
  - Roles: `ADMIN`, `LIBRARY_MANAGER`, `READER`.
  - CRUD operations for users.
- **Book Management**:
  - Create, update, delete, and search books by title, author, genre, or ISBN.
  - Borrow and return operations with availability tracking.
- **Borrow Service**:
  - Request, approve, complete, return, and extend borrow operations.
  - Borrow history tracking for users and books.
- **Notification Service**:
  - Send email notifications for due dates, approvals, and system alerts.
  - Retry failed notifications.
- **API Gateway**:
  - Central entry point for all client requests.
  - Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance.
  - Request correlation for traceability.
- **Event-Driven Communication**:
  - Kafka integration for async messaging between services.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Eureka, Gateway, Circuit Breaker)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka, Zookeeper
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Tools**: Maven, Swagger/OpenAPI

## Installation ðŸš€

### Prerequisites
- **Java**: JDK 17 or higher
- **Docker**: For containerization
- **PostgreSQL**: For local DB setup (if running outside Docker)
- **Maven**: For building microservices
- **Git**: For version control

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asseBadiane/Library-Management.git
cd Library-Management
```

#### 2. Run with Docker Compose
